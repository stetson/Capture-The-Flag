	<!-- See if you can draw up a really simple HTML page that explains the game, 
	how it works, how you log in, etc etc. We can add to this later, as well as 
	make it more "pretty". Also, include some statement about privacy, and how 
	we'll use Facebook information (show profile picture and name). -->

	<p>This is an online, version of Capture the flag that allows the users to use 
	the GPS in a device that can connect to the internet, and allows for the user 
	to be shown on the map to either play or observe a game in action. If the user
	only has internet capability then they will be placed into observer mode and
	be able to watch other players on the map.

	<br>
	<p>The way the user logs in is either by their facebook account or a guest 
	account.
	<br>
	<p>
	<br>
	<p>If the user is using their facebook account then they can show on their 
	facebook what they're doing 
	<br>
	<br><Font size=4><b>Action Mode</b></Font>
	<p>Action Mode is only activated if a few conditions are met.
	<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Your device hooks up to the internet.</li>
		<li>Your device has an active GPS signal.</li>
		<li>You log into your Facebook account.</li>
		<li>There are at least 2 people ready to play.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Then while the game is in action there are 2 visible signals to your 
	screen, where you are located, where your flag is located, where the 
	enemy flag is located, and the boundaries of the game.
	<br>
	<p>Each of the players will be evenly divided to make two teams, a red
	team and a blue team.
	<br>
	<p>If you pick up the enemies flag, everyone will be able to see the 
	flag move and thus know where you're located.
	<br>
	<p>If you are tagged while holding the flag, go indoors for a period of 
	time while holding the flag, or go out of bounds for a certain amount of 
	time while holding the flag, then the flag is placed randomly back onto 
	the enemie's field and you are placed in observer mode until you are back 
	on your side of the field. 
	<br>
	<p>To tag a person in capture the flag one must be within 30 meters of 
	an enemy, for the tag to be successful.
	<br>
	<p>If you are the one that is tagged than you must go back to your side of 
	the field until you are placed back into Action Mode  
	<br> 
	<p>Objective of the game is to take the enemy's flag and bring it back to 
	where your flag is located on the map, and your team gains a point.
	<br> 
	<p>If the opposing team has your flag while you have theirs then the game 
	cannot progress until one of the two flag holders gets tagged reseting your
	flag for your team to be able to score. 
	<br> 
	<p>There are three buttons available center on blue flag, center on red flag,
	and center on own position.
	<br>
	<p>
	<br> 
	<br><Font size=4><b>Observer Mode</b></Font>
	<br>
	<p>Observer mode is activated when:
	<br> 
	<ol>
		<li>You're on a device that has no GPS.</li>
		<li>You're inside a building.</li>
		<li>You're outside the bounds of the game.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This mode allows the user to watch a current game that is going on.
	Thus every player's position and the flag's position can be seen.
	<br> 
	<p>The buttons to center on Red Flag, and center on Blue flag will be 
	available as the center on self will be disabled. 
	<br> 
	<p>If one is sent into observer mode while playing a game then the game
	then the only game they can observe is the one they were playing in,
	unless they leave the game.
	<br> 
	<p>
	<br>   
	
	<h2><a name="signal_strength">Why do I get errors about geolocation?</a></h2>
	<p>To play capture the flag, it is necessary to have very accurate readings from a GPS device. 
	If this is not available, you will still be able to watch others play the game, but you yourself
	will not be able to. Please ensure that your GPS device is on, and that you have given permissions
	in your browser to use it.</p>
